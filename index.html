		<p> I am a critical-thinking problem solver able to thrive in self-motivated and team-based environments. Driven by a desire to learn and innovate I pick up new skills quickly and constantly hone existing skills.</p>

		<p>I immerse myself in the task at hand and constantly challenge assumptions and traditions yearning for the possibility of improvement. I get the greatest joy from translating personal development of skills and knowledge into	 tangible improvements in the projects I am involved with. </p>
